# Overview

Robo Dan is a modular personal Discord bot with an ever-growing set of features.

Currently the features include:

- Reminders
- YouTube/Reddit/Twitter/etc. video downloader
- Sonarr interfacing
- Speech-to-text transcription

Since this is a self-serving personal project, I add features that I need, or when I am motivated to learn a specific topic.

## Installation

If you are proficient with the technologies used in this project, feel free to self-host R. Dan
