# Overview

Robo Dan is a personal utility bot I use on Discord that features:

- YouTube/Reddit/etc video downloader
- Sonarr interfacing to download TV shows (Usenet)
- Reminders
- Various image manipulation commands

The entirety of the reminder system (including the user-configurable timezone) was borrowed from [Robo Danny](https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny), so a massive thanks to Danny.

## Running

I would prefer you don't host your own version of my bot, despite the use of Docker, getting this bot running is a huge pain in the ass and requires a bunch of config.

This repository exists to serve as educational material for this interested in learning discord.py or adding similar features to their own bot.
